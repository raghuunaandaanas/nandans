2.3 Entry Signal Logic (describe in detail):
Basically inventor has provided us the following info only If any stocks , futures, options,
anything in market works with numbers and levels NO INDICATOR or Any other tech tools are used.
Inventor of this stratergy is from Mysore India. He had cracked market Behaviour with numbers
he has provided us his prop stratergy.

there was a machine learning which was recording all patterns on the lines 
BU1-BU5 (for Bullish) and Be5 ( for reversals turning from earish to bullish)

his master key number is 0.2611 the same number is used in all the complete trading this is used 
by multiple variations like 0.2611,2.61,26.11 but at the end its the same number which if u add 
stands 1 2+6+1+1=10=1

any stocks works in a range and to cross the range it need to pass through these levels. 
if x stock is 123456.00  or 12345,1234,123,12,1 each number has a micro fib which is numbers. 
for example for 100 seeries  (0.0,     11.8,     23.6,     38.2,     50.0,     61.8,     78.2,     100.0)
he had this fixed number fib if any range shifts it was trading alsong with retesting 
and non restesting trades. and ML used to learn and improvide these numbers and was 
showing based on numbers early entry and early exists
inside this also he had system like he had given clew to ML  system the 95,45 rejections , 18 is support 
28 and 78( rally zonees. ) if 3 touch to 20 and not reversed below 14.5 then there will be a rally 
on that number from 29-46 extending upto 60  teh same applies for 78-96 and extending till 113


level calculation 

from the 1st close prices where market started from that close price it has to move 0.2611% and above
to trend so close price (base price of timeframe) x0.2611%= points . once you get the points 
add again back with base price = BU1 and if you less the points with Base price is BE1. 
which is the side ways zone. If any stock has to trend either on bullish side or bearish side 
it has to cross atlease 0.2611% and this number can be used in multiple combinational ways
1 . 0.2611% (10000-99999), 2.61%(1000-9999), 3. 26.11%(0-999)
how you can manage the volatality and trend and trade you can you any of these
for example nifty futures is 26000 as base price so 26000*0.2611% = 67.886 so to trend it has to leave 
26067.88 and above to trend bullish and 25933.00 and below to trend bearish
and for the same ce and pe of it works like lets assume a premium of 100 so = 100*0.2611%= points(micro)
 and also 100*2.61% = points(mini) and 100*26.11%= points(mega) and same after this it was calculating 
 bu1/BE1 based on the same timeframes like first which is most important close price , 1, 5 ,15 and 
 then based on this it was HFT trading keeping the 50%( based on close only )if candle closes of same timeframe 
 if trading one 1min then 1min candle close below the base and BU1 50% and close is the SL
 and targets would be baseprice*points*2=BU2,baseprice*points*3=BU3, baseprice*points*4=BU4 , baseprice*points*5=BU5
BU5/BE5 are the major reversal zones based on this you can take the opp strike if a call is near BU5 so you can take a put option 
pe and buy so you can get early bullish reversal entery the same is for be2,be3,be4. and same replicate
in this way it was trading auto on all symbols based on this stratergy and it was 85%+ accurate and was having all the patterns on ML machine level learnt
on these levels BU1-BU5 abd Be5 and FIB numbers

it was doing option selling on delta when any options goes to bu1 and takes rejection it was selling buy
and when a stock hits Be1 and Turns back he was selling puts.

and there was one more catch . Most of the times tere were spikes which was taken care by spike manager. 
along with ML it was knowing which is real and which is fake numbers of along fib attached.

so based on volatality.. he was deciding numbers of fic. 
if ltp is 123456.00 he was taking for HFT 6 last number and then same, slighty more price movement 56
more 45 so after this he was taking stocks into long scalle options and monitoring the opposite strikes
to swwing like and he called it traderscope he was the inventor of traderscope and b5 factor
it was so intelligent it knew when to use what and mix and trade. 

all his sl was based on same levels but he always concentrated on close price for any sl or tp and 
the inventor also told a tp any of the range 50% is the reversals and continue stage .. check a pluse here

Raghuu Naandaana s work fetched and started a small accont of 50rs on BTC with same it caputed 
his predection was so accurate he pulled BTC from bumber 123600.00which if u see is 23.6 of 10000 as 
fib number he pulled from these till 78600.00( which is here 78.6) from 123600. he created HFT was started checking from last 0
till 0,0,6,3,2,1( its like 123600) and reverse engineered all nubers as movements and captured complete
this was showing all levels and all trades on ui in different tabs
and was auto paper and real trade same copied. 
enable options to paper trade , treal trade and both 
he had some db which is missing which backtested all symbols backtesting with history and ML was learning along 
it knew BU1-BU5 is buying one BU5/BE5 are reversal zones. 

he had also discovered. if the price doesnt move above or below BU1/BE1 for 75 min then that whole day
the stock will not trend. and it will be premium day ( to capture premium)
he decided stocks which may trend which may not trend. 

he was using the same stratergy to find best investment option on stocks reversing from Be5 based 
on 1st day of the month , 1st month of the year and also he was showing Bullish symbols of the month 
and bullish stocks of the year based on stocks bu1-bu5. 
he was always using close price. and he was reentering and pyramidding orders on this levels.

(most of the times it was the same which was in future becomming support and resitance. 
this was predecting before it happens and ML was learning that (this was in last stage) this was on teh 
testing page.)-- TESTING STAGE
