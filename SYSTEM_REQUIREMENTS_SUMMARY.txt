SYSTEM REBUILD - REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY
=====================================
Based on Questionnaire Responses
Date: February 18, 2026

=============================================================================
WHAT WE HAVE - CORE STRATEGY INFORMATION
=============================================================================

INVENTOR: Raghuu Naandaana S (Mysore, India)
STRATEGY NAME: B5 Factor / Traderscope
MASTER NUMBER: 0.2611 (sum = 2+6+1+1 = 10 = 1)

CORE CONCEPT:
- Market works with numbers and levels, NO indicators
- Stocks move in ranges and must pass through specific levels to trend
- Uses Fibonacci-like numbers with 0.2611 as the key factor

LEVEL CALCULATION:
- Base Price = 1st candle close price of timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m)
- Points = Base Price × Factor
- Factor variations based on price range:
  * 0-999: 26.11% (mega)
  * 1000-9999: 2.61% (mini)
  * 10000-99999: 0.2611% (micro)

- BU Levels (Bullish):
  * BU1 = Base + (Points × 1)
  * BU2 = Base + (Points × 2)
  * BU3 = Base + (Points × 3)
  * BU4 = Base + (Points × 4)
  * BU5 = Base + (Points × 5)

- BE Levels (Bearish):
  * BE1 = Base - (Points × 1)
  * BE2 = Base - (Points × 2)
  * BE3 = Base - (Points × 3)
  * BE4 = Base - (Points × 4)
  * BE5 = Base - (Points × 5)

KEY ZONES:
- BU1/BE1: Sideways zone - must cross to trend
- BU5/BE5: Major reversal zones
- 50% of any range: Reversal and continuation stage

FIBONACCI NUMBERS FOR 100 SERIES:
0.0, 11.8, 23.6, 38.2, 50.0, 61.8, 78.2, 100.0

SPECIAL NUMBERS:
- 95, 45: Rejection zones
- 18: Support
- 28, 78: Rally zones
- 3 touches to 20 without reversing below 14.5 = rally from 29-46 extending to 60
- Same applies for 78-96 extending to 113

TRADING RULES:
1. Entry: When price crosses BU1 (bullish) or BE1 (bearish)
2. Stop Loss: 50% between Base and BU1, based on candle close
3. Targets: BU2, BU3, BU4, BU5
4. Reversal Trading: Sell calls at BU5, sell puts at BE5
5. Re-entry: Pyramid on levels
6. Non-Trending Day: If price doesn't move above/below BU1/BE1 for 75 minutes

HFT LOGIC:
- Uses last digits of price (e.g., 123456.00 → uses 6, then 56, then 456)
- Spike manager to detect real vs fake movements
- ML learns patterns on BU1-BU5 and BE5 levels

TIMEFRAMES:
- Always uses 1st candle close of: 1m, 5m, 15m
- Also: 1st day of month, 1st month of year

INSTRUMENTS:
- BTC Options & Futures (Delta Exchange, starts 5:30 AM IST)
- Nifty & Bank Nifty Options & Futures (NSE, starts 9:15 AM)
- All NFO stocks and index options
- All BFO index options

SYSTEM FEATURES:
- Auto paper trading
- Auto real trading
- HFT mode
- Machine Learning pattern recognition
- Backtesting with historical data
- Investment recommendations (stocks reversing from BE5)
- Monthly and yearly bullish stock predictions

ACCURACY: 85%+

FAMOUS TRADE:
- Started with 50 Rs on BTC
- Predicted BTC move from 123600 (23.6 fib) to 78600 (78.6 fib)
- Used reverse engineering of numbers
