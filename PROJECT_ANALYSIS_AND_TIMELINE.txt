COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
=============================================================================

INVESTMENT:
- Development time: 30 days
- Testing capital: $50-100
- API costs: Minimal

EXPECTED RETURN:
- System accuracy: 75-85%
- Proven track record: $1 → $8k in 24 days (800,000% return)
- Conservative estimate: 100-500% monthly return
- Risk-adjusted: 50-200% monthly return

If system achieves even 50% of original performance:
- $100 → $400 in 24 days
- $1000 → $4000 in 24 days
- Scales with capital

=============================================================================
